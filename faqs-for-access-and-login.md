# FAQs for access and login
{: #faqs-for-access-and-login } 

Read frequently asked questions regarding access and login.
{: shortdesc} 

A collection of frequently asked questions regarding access and login.

## How do I activate the portal for use by my organization?
{: #13809-activate-the-portal-for-use-by-my-organ } 

Follow the instructions in [Getting
started](/docs/managed-solutions/getting-started.html "Getting started").

Let us follow a user, John Doe, whose email is john.doe@XZYCompany.com.
He registers with IBM Cloud for an IBMid. This gives him an identity
(login credentials) for IBM Cloud and an account called `John Doe's
Account`. He navigates to Managed Solutions in the left navigation pane
and sees the Managed Applications welcome page. His Delivery Project
Executive gave him an access code and he uses it on the welcome page.
This links the Managed Applications account for XYZ Company to the IBM
Cloud account for John Doe.

John Doe invites another user, Davin Smith. Davin creates his IBM Cloud
account. When Davin enters IMB Cloud Console, he has access to two
accounts: `Davin Smith's Account` and `John Doe's Account`. To avoid the
Davin's confusion over which account is which, John Doe follows the
instructions in [Editing the account
name](/docs/account?topic=account-account_settings#change-acct-name) and
changes the account name of his account from `John Doe's Account` to
`XYZ Company`. Now Davin sees the two accounts: `Davin Smith's Account`
and `XYZ Company`. Confusion alleviated\!

## How do I get an access code?
{: #13809-get-an-access-code } 

Contact your Delivery Project Executive, who will provide you with your
access code.

## What do I do if my access code expired?
{: #13809-do-if-my-access-code-expired } 

Contact your Delivery Project Executive, who can provide you with a new

## How do I reset my password?
{: #13809-reset-my-password } 

If you are logged in, you can reset your password from your profile:
follow the instructions in [How do I reset my
password?](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#reset-password).

If you have not logged in:

1.  Open IBM Cloud console.

2.  Click **Forgot password?**.
    
    The Having trouble logging in? page appears. Follow the instructions
    on that page.

## What do I do if I cannot log in?
{: #13809-do-if-i-cannot-log-in } 

Contact the [IBMid worldwide help
desk](https://www.ibm.com/ibmid/myibm/help/us/helpdesk.html){: external}. You can
also retrieve that page from the IBM Cloud login page.

1.  Open IBM Cloud console.

2.  Click **Forgot password?**.
    
    The Having trouble logging in? page appears.

3.  Click **Contact IBMid Helpdesk**.
    
    The IBMid worldwide help desk page appears.

## Why do I see only the welcome page?
{: #13809-see-only-the-welcome-page } 

There are four scenarios in which you will always receive the welcome
page rather than your managed applications. There are two aspects to
each scenario:

1.  Whether an IBM Cloud account is enabled for IBM Services for Managed
    Applications.
    
    There is no visual indication in the IBM Cloud Console that an IBM
    Cloud account is enabled for IBM Services for Managed Applications.
    You must ask an appropriate administrator within your organization
    or your Delivery Project Executive to learn if an IBM Cloud account
    is enabled.

2.  Whether you have been invited to that account.
    
    If you are not the account owner, you will see at least two accounts
    in your account list, your personal account associated with your
    identity in IBMid and the organization's account to which you were
    invited.

The four scenarios emerge from the yes or no combinations of those two
aspects.

### You have been invited to the account...
{: #13809-you-have-been-invited-to-the-account } 

#### And an IBM Cloud account is enabled
{: #13809-and-an-ibm-cloud-account-is-enabled } 

If you have viewed your managed application previously then you know
that you have been invited to the account and an IBM Cloud account is
enabled.

Ensure you select the correct account.

1.  From the list next to <svg aria-label="pencil with paper"
    alt="pencil with paper" viewBox="0 0 32 32" width="16"

    applications.

#### But no IBM Cloud account is enabled
{: #13809-but-no-ibm-cloud-account-is-enabled } 

You or an appropriate administrator within your organization must obtain
an access code from your Delivery Project Executive and follow the
instructions in [Getting
started](/docs/managed-solutions/getting-started.html "Getting started").

### You have not been invited to the account...
{: #13809-you-have-not-been-invited-to-the-accoun } 

#### But an IBM Cloud account is enabled
{: #13809-but-an-ibm-cloud-account-is-enabled } 

You must contact an appropriate administrator within your organization
and request that they invite you to the IBM Cloud account enabled for
IBM Services for Managed
Applications.

#### And no IBM Cloud account is enabled for IBM Services for Managed Applications
{: #13809-and-no-ibm-cloud-account-is-enabled-for } 

You or an appropriate administrator within your organization must obtain
an access code from your Delivery Project Executive and follow the
instructions in [Getting
started](/docs/managed-solutions/getting-started.html "Getting started").
If you are not that administrator, then you must also request the
administrator to invite you to the account.
