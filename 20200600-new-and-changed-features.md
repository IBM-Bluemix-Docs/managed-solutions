{: shortdesc} 

This section describes new and changed functionality for 2020-06-00.

## Managed Applications Portal enhancements
- A new feature Custom Views is implemented in the Support portal comprising the following features:
  - Users can set batch filters, global filters, sorting order, pagination in Incident, Service and Change Request ticket types in the order of their preference and save them as views.
  - Users can name, rename, edit and delete these saved views
  - Users can save multiple views and have one of the saved views as their default view
  - A view without any filters, pagination applied is available as Standard View. 

-	Support portal users will now be able to see formatted text instead of embedded line feeds in the communication log whenever an action is performed in the portal to enable Service Now users easily understand the performed actions. 

-	Outage date and time fields are added to the Incident with Outage ticket type to let the users specify the date and time of outage during ticket creation. 

-	Metrics portal is further enhanced with the below features:
 - Radio buttons are added to the multiple dimension filters in the Select Dimension Filters pop-up window to enable users select appropriate dimension for accurate data display.  
 - Auto refresh option is no longer available in the Metrics portal until the users click Submit while editing an existing metric, adding, deleting and copying a metric.
