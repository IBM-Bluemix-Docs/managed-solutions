Learn how to view your service support cases.

You can view all your service support cases. Service support cases are
separated onto three tabs by the type of case.

  - **Service Requests** - requests for new services
  - **Incidents** - requests to correct issues with services

The information shown for each type of case is the same. If a case has
more than one configuration item associated or if the configuration
items are located in more than one location, click the information,
