# Use security with application programming interfaces
{: #use-security-with-application-programming-int } 

Learn about and how to use the security features of application programming interfaces.
{: shortdesc} 

As a fully RESTful application programming interface (API), each call to
any IBM Services for Managed Applications API requires authentication
and authorization. Because IBM Services for Managed Applications is
hosted by IBM Cloud, security services are provided by IBM Cloud.

  - For an overview of IBM Cloud application security, visit [Security
    and Identity](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/apidocs?category=security){: external},
    especially [Authorization and
    Authentication](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/app-id/auth){: external}.
  - To begin using IBM Cloud application security, visit [IBM Cloud App
    ID](/docs/services/appid/index.html#gettingstarted), especially [Key
    Concepts](/docs/services/appid/authorization.html#key-concepts).
  - For specifics of obtaining an IBM Cloud token for a call, see
    [Managing identity and access](/docs/iam/quickstart.html#getstarted)
    especially [Getting an IBM Cloud IAM token by using an API
    key](/docs/iam/apikey_iamtoken.html#iamtoken_from_apikey).
