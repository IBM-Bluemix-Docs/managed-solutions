2020-09-00 New and changed features.
{: shortdesc} 

This section describes new and changed functionality for release 2020-09-00.

## Managed Applications Portal enhancements
- The Support Portal has been enhanced with the following features:
  - The creation of an Incident has been simplified by merging the existing two screens (Incident and Incident with Outage) into one.
  - When creating an Incident with an outage, the outage time field now has an AM/PM indicator and the phone number field now preselects the country code from a list (only if the browser language settings provide the country).
  - Entering the preferred start and end dates when creating a Change Request has been simplified. Now you can open and close the date range field to set, edit or clear the dates.
  - When creating a case, if the account has only one contract, it will be pre-selected.
  - The performance of the case details page has been improved. Navigating the tabs is now faster.
  - Creating a case from an existing one now copies the watchlist.
