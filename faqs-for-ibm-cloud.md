IBM Cloud is a platform that helps developers build and run modern
applications and services. It provides developers with instant access to
the compute and services they need to launch quickly, iterate
continuously, and scale with success. With services across mobile, IoT,
IBM Watson and more, IBM Cloud is an ideal platform to power the next
wave of applications that thrive on data.

Among the services available on IBM Cloud is IBM Services for Managed
Applications.

for some issues you must contact IBM Cloud support and for other issues
you can open a case in Managed Applications
Portal.
