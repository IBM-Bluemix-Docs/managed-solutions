2020-11-00 New and changed features.
{: shortdesc} 

This section describes new and changed functionality for release 2020-11-00.

## Managed Applications Portal enhancements
- The Applications page of the Apps portal has been upgraded with the capability of saving the current view configuration and switching between previously saved ones.
- The Health portal UI has been updated to provide a user experience more consistent with the rest of the portals.
- In the Core portal's server inventory, a new column "Server Type" was added. Also, AIX servers will show the processor mode next to the number of CPUs. This only applies to SAP servers.
- The Support Portal has been enhanced with the following features:
  - When adding an _Affected Configuration Item_ to a case, the _Storage Disk_ class is now filtered out from the list to only show relevant options.
  - The _Cases_ option that showed CRs, SRs and Incidents in different tabs has been split into three separate options. Now CRs, SRs and Incidents can be directly accessed by clicking on its own menu option. Clicking on the _Create Case_ button will create a case of the selected type only.
  - When editing an Incident with Outage, if the priority is lowered to P2 or below the Business Outage information will be removed. Changing the priority back to P1 will not enable the Business Outage option.
  - The _Change Request Approvers_ page has been improved with a more responsive user experience.
