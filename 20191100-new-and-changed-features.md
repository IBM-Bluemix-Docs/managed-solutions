2019.11.00 New and changed features.
{: shortdesc} 

This section describes new and changed functionality for 2019.11.00.

## Managed Applications Portal enhancements

  - Managed Application portal code and APIs are refactored to version 2 for better performance, scalability and user experience.
  - Solution Management is rolled out to portal users to help them define their resource groups and assign access to the group 
    as a whole or to individuals. Every time an account is created or updated with a contract, a solution gets created in the Customer 
    portal (Unified Portal) and the Account owners can IAM enable and configure access policy for each of these solutions. Access is 
    classified as Platform level and Service level.  By default, customers are assigned Platform role and can access all solutions 
    for the account across the entire platform. For IAM enabled solutions, service roles such as Reader, Writer and Manager are 
    assigned to a user who can perform only specific actions within a specified solution.
